# 2D CFD

An open-source, two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics solver using the lattice-Boltzman methods.

## Getting Started

A copy of a similar application is written in four different apps: a Java app, a Processing app, a Python app, and a webpage app.  To get started with any of these, click on the respective folder and make sure that you have the following prerequisites installed.

## Prerequisites

**Java App**
* Java 1.8

**Processing App**
* [The latest build of Processing](https://processing.org/download/) from [Processing.org](https://processing.org)

**Python App**
* [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Then, install the following modules via ```pip3 install```
* ```numpy```, tested with 1.16.2
* ```time```, tested with 1.0.0
* ```matplotlib```, tested with 3.0.3

**Webpage App**
* ```HTML``` with ```CSS``` and ```Javascript```

## Installing

Clone or download this Git repository to your computer.  From there, use an IDE or terminal to run the program:

**Java App**

The Java version can be run as a .jar file or from its source in your favorite IDE, such as Eclipse.  To run the .jar file:

```
cd [Insert path to folder where .jar was saved]
java -jar java_2dcfd.jar
```

**Processing App**

Launch the Processing IDE by opening the main.pde file from your computer.

**Python App**

```
python3 [file path]/latticeBoltzmannDemo.py
```

**Webpage App**

Runnable from ```Fluid Dynamics Simulation.html```
